## [1.2.2] - 2025-07-16

- Closes https://github.com/daniellionel01/parrot/issues/30<br />

## [1.2.1] - 2025-07-08

- Bug Fix https://github.com/daniellionel01/parrot/issues/27<br />
  This is an edge case when you cast a type for a non-named argument, which lead to
  an empty string for the gleam function parameter.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-01

- Only issue a warning when download of sqlc binary was not successfull. This makes parrot
  work without an internet connection if sqlc is already downloaded or installed system wide.
- Use system wide sqlc binary as fallback, if local sqlc binary throws an error. This
  is an edge case on MacOS.

- Support `List` columns in Postgres.<br />
  **Requires handling `dev.ParamList` in wrapper**
- Decodes `JSON`, `JSONB`, `MONEY`
  (not `Dynamic` anymore)
- Support for Postgres & MySQL `ENUM`
  (creates a custom type)
- Improved testing for all databases
  (more data types & operations)
- Use of `assert` syntax
  (instead of `gleeunit/should`)

## [1.0.1] - 2025-06-19

- Provide empty list instead of `Nil` when there are no parameters for a consistent return type

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-19
